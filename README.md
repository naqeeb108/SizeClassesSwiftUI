# SizeClassesSwiftUI

This is a basic overview of using size classes to build adoptive layout in SwiftUI. 

SwiftUI provides us **@Environament** property wrapper for both horizontalSizeClass and verticalSizeClass. Firstly we need to store value in like below

```sh
   @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass
   @Environment(\.verticalSizeClass) var verticalSizeClass
 ```
Then we can check for the value 

```
  if horizontalSizeClass == .compact {
     print("compact")
  }

  if horizontalSizeClass == .regular {
     print("regular")
  }
```

If you want to know more about **Device size classes** based on orientation then check out Layout section in Human interface guidelines here https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/layout/

Size Classes are super useful to create adoptive design along differnt screen sizes. Here is an example of dummy UI on IPhone12 pro and IPad pro 12.9 inches.
